## Design document for boost.request

The goal of this library is to provide an easy way for users to send http requests.
It should be as simple as this:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
    using namespace boost;
    auto res = requests::get<beast::http::string_body>(
        "https://boost.org/index.html",
        modifiers(accept("text/html")),
        options{.follow_redirects = true}));

    std::cout << res.body() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Alternatively, the an async api should be provided and defaulted to futures as well:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
    using namespace boost;
    auto doc_future = requests::async_get<beast::http::file_body>(
        "https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/1.79.0/source/boost_1_79_0.tar.gz",
        modifiers(accept("text/html"),
        file("./boost_1_79.tar.gz")),
        options{.follow_redirects = true});

    std::cout << index_future.get() << std::endl;
    doc_future.get();;
    return 0;
}
```

NOTE: It might be preferable to not use a body but a type, i.e. `std::string` in this case.


## Connections

At the core are http_connection and https_connections, which shall manage their own connection, and be secured by a semaphore, mutex or channel to allow concurrent calls to async_*.

Similar to every other class they shall offer the following functions:

 - request<T = beast::http::string_body>(http::method, urls::string_view target, RequestBody &&, modifiers<Ts...>, options) -> beast::http::response<T>;

For each http method there shall be an overload taking the expected body type into account:

 - get<T = beast::http::string_body>(urls::string_view target, modifiers<Ts...>, options) -> beast::http::response<T>;
 - head(urls::string_view target, modifiers<Ts...>, options) -> beast::http::response< boost::http::empty_body >;

And so on.

The request body type shall be deduced by type_trait form the passed RequestBody type.
A string leads to a string_body, a std::filesystem::path to a file_body. The empty body shall be denoted by a special `empty` type.

Additionally it shall be possible to connect the http connection to a host like so:

 - connect_to_host(urls::string_view host, urls::string_view service) -> void;

Furthermore it shall be possible to upgrade a connection to a websocket.
 - upgrade(urls::string_view target, modifiers<Ts...>, options) && -> websocket::stream;

All of those functions shall be available as async_* as well.

Furthermore a connection must have a member allowing the inspection of ongoing reads and writes so a pool can choose which connection to use.

### Modifiers and options

The reason modifiers are used is so it is an open set. A modifier shall get called and passed a non const reference to the request before sending it, and with a const response after receiving it. This will allow implementation of features like a cookie jar.
Option modify the behaviour and not only the request, such as following redirect, or retrying when the request failed in certain case (e.g. retry-later).

### connection_pool
The connection shall be manageable by a connection_pool, which creates connections as needed up to a set limit. It shall have the same functions as the connections and work on one host for one protocol (that is http://boost.org can't use https://boost.org).
A connection pool is allowed to connect to different endpoints for the same DNS name.
A upgraded connection shall be removed from the connection_pool and not count towards it's limit.

A connection pool must recreate closed connection when a request failed because the connection was dropped.

### session
A session is a map of pools, grouped by (host, port, service [http or https]). It shall have the same functions as the connection, but not take a string_view for the target, but a full urls::url_view to refer to a host and target. The session internally manages the connections and state.

### session_service

In order to allow session less HTTP requests, there shall be a service on a given execution_context, that contains a session, and cleans it up on shutdown.

This will allow async_request to be executed on an explicit execution context, like so:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
    using namespace boost;
    asio::io_context ctx;
auto res_fut = requests::async_get<beast::http::string_body>(ctx,
"https://boost.org/index.html",
modifiers(accept("text/html")),
options{.follow_redirects = true}));

    ctx.run();
    std::cout << res.get().body() << std::endl;
return 0;
}
```
or on the execution context of the completion token. Unless specifier otherwise the default is `use_future`.  If no context is specified this will default to the `system_executor` allowing users to execute async queries without explicit management of any io context.

For that reason, all of the code needs to be thread-safe; it might furthermore be desirable to have a connection object send anothe request while it is reading the answer of the last.
