Primer
------

Coroutines are resumable functions; regular functions get called once, and leave upon completion, where as coroutine keep their state and can get resumed.

[source,cpp]
----
fictional_eager_coro_type<int> example()
{
    printf("In coro 1\n");
    co_yield 2;    
    printf("In coro 3\n");
}

int main()
{
    printf("In main 0\n");
    auto f = example(); // call and let it run until the first co_yield
    printf("In main 2\n");
    f.reenter();
    printf("In main 4\n");
    return 0;
}
----

Which will generate the following output

 In main 0
 In coro 1
 In main 2
 In coro 3
 In main 4

The 

  differnet to a state machine is that a coroutine keeps internal state and reads like a linear function.

NOTE: The above coroutine is eager, i.e. it runs to the first `co_yield` right away. A lazy coroutine would only do that after the first call to `reenter`.

Awaiting
~~~~~~~~

The co_yield passes a value to the caller and waits for the caller to resume.

Awaiting makes the coroutine the caller that suspends until the callee is ready to return a value.

[source,cpp]
----
fictional_eager_coro_type<int> example()
{
    co_await sleep(2);    
}
----



Stackless
~~~~~~~~~

C++20 coroutines are stackless, meaning they don't have their own stack.

A stack in C++ describes the callstack, i.e. all the function frames stacked.
A function frame is the memory a function needs to operate, i.e. a slice of memory
to store it's variables and information such as the return address.

NOTE: The size of a function frame is known at compile time.

[source, cpp]
----

int bar() {return 0;} // the deepest point of the stack
int foo() {return bar();}

int main()
{
    return bar();
}
----

The call stack in the above example is:

[source]
----
main()
  foo()
    bar()
----

Coroutines can be implemented a stackful, which means that it allocates a fixes chunk of memory and stacks function frames similar to a thread. 
C++20 coroutines are stackless, i.e. they only allocate their own frame and use the callers stack on resumption. Using our previous example:

[source,cpp]
----
fictional_eager_coro_type<int> example()
{
    co_yield 0;
    co_yield 1;
}

void nested_resume(fictional_eager_coro_type<int>& f)
{
    f.resume();
}

int main()
{
    auto f = example(); 
    nested_resume(f);
    f.reenter();
    return 0;
}
----

This will yield a call stack similar to this:

[source]
----
main()
  f$example()
  nested_resume()
    f$example()
  f$example()  
----

The same applies if a coroutine gets moved accross threads.
